# Contributing Guide

## How to contribute

* Fork the project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR)
  * Fully explain what the PR adds or fixes
* Be sensible in the number and clarity of your commits
  * sqashing locally makes things nicer to review
## Considerations
* Is this a bug?
  * check to see if an issue already exists
* Is this a small fix and/or addition? (eg. docs, code style, small bug, etc.)
  * feel free to open a request with included description
* Is this a series of small fixes or additions?
  * please consider splitting the changes into different PRs if they aren't related. It's up to your discretion, but you may be asked to split them up if it appears the PR isn't focused on a single issue.
* Is this a large bug or feature?
  * please make sure there is an associated issue created and there's been feedback on the best way forward
  * PRs with large changes without an associated issue will be rejected.
## Code standards
* Please keep things similar to the rest of the code in the project (eg. indentation/spacing, use of semicolons, etc.)
